There is no code for this project, but everything is documented in this README.

First, I set up a Debian 12.x 64-bit Arm **Kali Linux** machine on my personal MacBook through VMWare Fusion.

I allocated 4 processor cores and 2048 MB memory with shared internet with my MacBook.

On my newly installed Kali Linux machine, I messed around with many cybersecurity tools including Nmap, Gobuster, and Wireshark.

I also use this VM as the attacker machine for my Keylogger script within my Hacking Tools project, where I use Metasploit to discreetly exfiltrate keystrokes from my MacBook to my Kali Linux machine.
